# Bootstrap:Algebra Teachpacks for DrRacket

These files contain all the necessary teachpacks for [the Fall2020 version of Bootstrap:Algebra](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2020/en-us/courses/algebra-wescheme). They are NOT actively maintained, but we'll accept bug reports in the unlikely event that future versions of DrRacket change things in a way that breaks compatibility.

To install, download the .zip archive and extract it. The resulting folder contains all the necessary starter files and teachpacks, in the exact location they need to be. Your students can work through Bootstrap:Algebra using the files as-is!
